# Agile Retrospective

Creating user stories is the best way to communicate your wants and needs to your development team. The developers implement these stories into a program by breaking them down to simple functions and customizing them to the user's preference. For a successful development cycle, the best way to approach such cycle is by reviewing the user stories and making sure every single function and feature is acknowledge, to avoid speculation and misinterpretation. The agile process that I wish to incorporate into my future development work are Scrum events and team communication strategies, as I believe they're the most important for a tight sprint timelapse. For me, a good team member is the one that asks the most questions, is actively involved in the project, and helps others in their problems. Having a team member that succeeds in this description, enhances the team's chances in delivering a great, sustainable product.
